###demo eindresultaat
* zie url op canvas
* login with vera/vera, marie/password, admin/admin
* ... or signup to register as a new user

###you need:
* server: java 21 (on PATH)
* frontend: node (v22.3.0) and npm (10.8.1) (on PATH)
* import this repo in intellij (as maven project)
* repo contains server (in .) and client (in ./src/main/frontend)

###server
* start server
  * in intellij --> BookserverApplication start
  * or in cmd on dir bookserver:
      ```
      ./mvnw package
      java  -jar target\bookserver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar be.thomasmore.bookserver.BookserverApplication
      ```
* try out:
  * api GET request in browser: **GET http://localhost:8080/api/books**
  * api doc: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
  * h2-in-mem-db: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
    * jdbc url: jdbc:h2:mem:books
    * username: sa, no pw
  * postman:
    * import collection Books.postman_collection.json
    * or... import swagger-doc in postman: http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs
    * post/put/delete:
      * csrf-protection
      * copy value van XSRF-TOKEN Cookie in de Header X-XSRF-TOKEN
      * this is now done automatically in this collection - you only have to create an environment first (eg dev)
    * important: always keep postman colletion up-to-date in the repo
  * client is served by server
    * on index.html:  http://localhost:8080/
    * but you must do (at least) a "maven compile" first to make this work

###client
* start client
  * in intellij
  * or in cmd on dir bookserver/src/main/frontend:
      ```
          npm run start 
      ```
* try out: http://localhost:3000
* (or with ip)
* login with vera/vera, marie/password, admin/admin
* ... or signup to register as a new user
